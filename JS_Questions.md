Core JavaScript Concepts

Question 1: What is the difference between var, let, and const?
* var: Function-scoped, can be re-declared and re-assigned.
* let: Block-scoped, cannot be re-declared, can be re-assigned.
* const: Block-scoped, cannot be re-declared or re-assigned.

Question 2: Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.
* Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism that moves declarations to the top of their scope. Function declarations are hoisted before variable declarations.

Question 3: What is the difference between == and ===?
* performs type coercion before comparison.
* performs strict comparison, checking both value and type.

Question 4: What is a closure in JavaScript?
*  A closure is a function that has access to variables from its outer (lexical) scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

Question 5: What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript?
* The this keyword refers to the object that is executing the current function. Its value depends on how the function is called.

JavaScript Objects and Arrays
------------------------------
Question 6: How do you create an object in JavaScript?
* You can create an object using object literal syntax or the new Object() constructor.

Question 7: What is the difference between a primitive value and an object in JavaScript?
* Primitive values are immutable and stored on the stack. Objects are mutable and stored on the heap.

Question 8: How do you iterate over an array in JavaScript?
* You can use a for loop, for...of loop, forEach method, or map method to iterate over an array.

JavaScript Functions and Scope
------------------------------
Question 9: What is a higher-order function in JavaScript?
* A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as a result. Â  

Question 10: What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?
* Function declaration: Hoisted, can be used before declaration.
* Function expression: Not hoisted, cannot be used before declaration.

JavaScript Asynchronous Programming
-----------------------------------
Question 11: What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code execution?
* Synchronous code executes line by line, blocking the execution of subsequent code until it finishes.
* Asynchronous code executes non-blocking operations, allowing other code to run while the asynchronous operation is in progress.

Question 12: What is a promise in JavaScript?
*  A promise represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

Question 13: What is the difference between Promise.resolve and Promise.reject?
* Promise.resolve creates a resolved promise.
* Promise.reject creates a rejected promise.

JavaScript DOM Manipulation
---------------------------
Question 14: How do you select an element by its ID in JavaScript?
*  Use the getElementById method.

Question 15: How do you add event listeners to elements in JavaScript?
*  Use the addEventListener method.

Core Array Methods
-------------------

Question 1: What is the difference between forEach, map, filter, and reduce?
* forEach: Iterates over an array, performing a callback function on each element.
* map: Creates a new array by applying a callback function to each element of the original array.
* filter: Creates a new array containing elements from the original array that pass a test implemented by a provided function.
* reduce: Applies a function to an accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a single value.

Question 2: How do you create a new array from an existing array without modifying the original array?
*  Use the slice or concat method.

Question 3: How do you reverse the order of elements in an array?
*  Use the reverse method.

Question 4: How do you find the index of a specific element in an array?
*  Use the indexOf method.

Question 5: How do you sort an array in ascending or descending order?
* Use the sort method with a custom comparison function.

Advanced Array Methods
----------------------

Question 6: What is the some method used for?
*  The some method tests whether at least one element in the array passes a test implemented by a provided function.

Question 7: What is the every method used for?
*  The every method tests whether all elements in the array pass a test implemented by a provided function.

Question 8: How do you find the maximum or minimum value in an array?
*  Use the reduce method with a comparison function.

Question 9: What is the find method used for?
*  The find method returns the first element in the array that passes a test implemented by a provided function.

Question 10: What is the findIndex method used for?
*  The findIndex method returns the index of the first element in the array that passes a test implemented by a provided function.

Core JavaScript Concepts
------------------------
Variable Declaration:
=====================

Declare variables using var, let, and const. Explain their differences and when to use each.
Data Types:

Identify the different data types in JavaScript (numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, null, undefined).
Explain the difference between primitive values and objects.
Operators:

Demonstrate understanding of arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and ternary operators.
Write code examples using these operators.
Control Flow:

Implement if, else, else if, switch, for, while, and do...while statements.
Solve problems using these control flow constructs.
Functions:

Define and call functions with parameters and return values.
Explain the concept of closures and provide an example.
Objects:

Create objects using object literal notation and constructor functions.
Access and modify object properties.
Arrays:

Create and manipulate arrays using methods like push, pop, shift, unshift, slice, splice, concat, join, and reverse.
Implement array iteration using forEach, map, filter, and reduce.
DOM Manipulation
Selecting Elements:

Use getElementById, getElementsByTagName, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector to select elements.
Modifying Elements:

Change element attributes, content, and styles using JavaScript.
Event Handling:

Add event listeners to elements and handle events like clicks, mouseovers, and keypresses.
Asynchronous Programming
Callbacks:

Write code using callbacks to handle asynchronous operations.
Promises:

Create and use promises to manage asynchronous code.
Implement then, catch, and finally methods.
Async/Await:

Use async and await to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner.
Additional Topics
JSON:

Parse and stringify JSON data.
Regular Expressions:

Use regular expressions to match and manipulate text patterns.
Error Handling:

Implement try...catch blocks to handle errors.
Modules:

Use CommonJS or ES modules to organize code into separate files.
