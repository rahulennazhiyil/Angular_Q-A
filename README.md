* Sequence of Loading Angular
1. index.html: The main HTML file that includes the root element where the Angular app will be bootstrapped.
2. main.ts: The entry point that bootstraps the Angular application.
3. app.module.ts: The root module that declares and imports all necessary modules and components.
4. app.component.ts: The root component that serves as the main view of the application.
This sequence ensures that the Angular application is properly initialized and ready to run.

* Types of Directives
--> Components: These are directives with a template. They are the most common type of directive.
--> Attribute Directives: These change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.
--> Structural Directives: These change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.

Examples
--------
1. Component Directive
----------------------
A component is a directive with a template. For example, the AppComponent is a component directive.

2. Attribute Directives
Attribute directives change the appearance or behavior of an element. Common attribute directives include NgClass, NgStyle, and NgModel.
--> NgClass: Adds and removes a set of CSS classes.
--> NgStyle: Adds and removes a set of HTML styles.
--> NgModel: Adds two-way data binding to an HTML form element.

3. Structural Directives
------------------------
Structural directives change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements. Common structural directives include NgIf, NgFor, and NgSwitch.

--> NgIf: Conditionally includes a template based on the value of an expression.
--> NgFor: Repeats a template for each item in a list.
--> NgSwitch: Switches between alternative views based on a value.

Creating a Custom Directive
---------------------------
You can also create your own custom directives. Here’s an example of a simple attribute directive that changes the background color of an element when it is hovered over.
Generate the Directive:
** ng generate directive highlight

Implement the Directive:
TypeScript
Plain Text
// src/app/highlight.directive.ts
import { Directive, ElementRef, HostListener } from '@angular/core';
@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'})export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef) {}
  @HostListener('mouseenter') onMouseEnter() {
    this.highlight('yellow');
  }
  @HostListener('mouseleave') onMouseLeave() {
    this.highlight('');
  }
  private highlight(color: string) {
    this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = color;
  }
}
 
HTML
----
<p appHighlight>Hover over this text to see the highlight effect.</p>
 
Angular lifecycle hooks
-----------------------

Angular lifecycle hooks are special methods that Angular calls at specific points in the lifecycle of a component or directive. These hooks allow you to tap into key events and perform custom operations during the creation, update, and destruction of components.
-> Key Lifecycle Hooks
   -------------------
1. ngOnChanges: Called before ngOnInit and whenever one or more data-bound input properties change.
2. ngOnInit: Called once, after the first ngonChanges
3. ngDoCheck: Called during every change detection run, immediately after ngonChanges and ngOnInit
4. ngAfterContentInit: Called once after the first ngDoCheck
5. ngAfterContentChecked: Called after ngAfterContentInit and every subsequent ngDoCheck.
6. ngAfterViewInit: Called once after the first ngAfterContentChecked
7. ngAfterViewChecked: Called after ngAfterViewInit and every subsequent ngAfterContentChecked.
8. ngOnDestroy: Called just before Angular destroys the component.


==> What is Angular?
* Angular is a TypeScript-based front-end web application framework.
* It’s used for designing single-page applications (SPAs) and offers features like components, services, modules, and routing.

==> How does an Angular application work?
* Every Angular app has an angular.json file that contains configurations. The builder looks at this file to find the entry point of the application.
* The entry point is usually the main.ts file, where Angular bootstraps the app by calling platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule).

==> What are Angular components?
* Components are the building blocks of an Angular app. They encapsulate HTML, CSS, and logic.
* To create a component, use the Angular CLI command: ng generate component component-name.

==> What is data binding in Angular?
* Data binding connects the UI (template) with the component’s data. Types of data binding: Interpolation, Property binding, Event binding, and Two-way binding.

==> What is Angular CLI?
* Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool for creating, managing, and building Angular projects.
* Use ng new to create a new project and ng serve to run it locally.

==> What is lazy loading in Angular?
* Lazy loading loads modules only when needed, improving app performance.
* Use the loadChildren property in the route configuration to enable lazy loading.

==> What is Angular service?
* Services provide reusable logic and data to components.
* Create a service using ng generate service service-name.

==> What is dependency injection in Angular?
* Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern where components receive their dependencies from an external source (usually a service).
* Angular’s DI system manages the injection of services into components.

==> How do you handle HTTP requests in Angular?
* Use Angular’s HttpClientModule to make HTTP requests.
Example:
TypeScript
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
constructor(private http: HttpClient) {
  this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data').subscribe(response => {
    console.log(response);
  });
}

==> What are Angular directives?
* Directives are instructions in the DOM. Examples: *ngFor, *ngIf, and custom directives.
* Custom directives can be created using @Directive decorator.

==> What is the purpose of the @Input and @Output decorators?
* @Input is used to pass data from parent to child components, 
* while @Output is used to emit events from child to parent components.

==> How do you pass data from a parent to a child component?
* Use the @Input decorator on the child component's property. 

==> What is lazy Loading?
* Lazy Loading in Angular refers to a technique where components or modules are only loaded when they are needed, 
rather than all at once when the application initially starts. This can significantly improve performance,
 especially for larger applications with many components.



BASIC COMMANDS USED IN ANGULAR
------------------------------

* ng new <project-name>: 
==> Creates a new Angular workspace and generates a new application skeleton. Replace <project-name> with your desired project name.
* ng serve:
==> Builds and serves your Angular application locally. It automatically rebuilds the app and reloads the page when you make changes to the source files. Access it at http://localhost:4200/.
* ng generate <schematic>:
==>  Generates various parts of your application, such as components, services, modules, and more. For example:
* ng generate component my-component: 
==> Creates a new component.
* ng generate service my-service: 
==> Generates a new service.
* ng build: 
==> Compiles your application into an output directory (usually dist/). Use the --prod flag for production builds.

Technical Questions
===================

==> What is Angular, and how does it differ from other frameworks like React or Vue?
*  Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework developed by Google. It is a full-fledged framework, offering a complete solution for building dynamic, single-page applications. Unlike React, which is a library focused on UI, Angular provides a more opinionated architecture with features like dependency injection, two-way data binding, and a powerful CLI for project management. Vue, on the other hand, is more flexible and easier to integrate into projects incrementally, whereas Angular is more suited for larger applications.

==> How do you handle state management in Angular applications?
*  In Angular, state management can be handled using various approaches depending on the application's complexity. For simpler applications, services can be used to manage and share state between components. For more complex applications, state management libraries like NgRx can be used, which follows the Redux pattern. NgRx allows for centralized management of application state and provides powerful tools like actions, reducers, and selectors to manage state changes predictably.

==> Can you explain how Angular's dependency injection works?
*  Angular's dependency injection (DI) system is a core feature that allows classes and components to request dependencies from an injector rather than creating them directly. The DI system makes it easier to manage code, especially in larger applications, by allowing dependencies to be injected into components and services. This promotes better code organization and facilitates testing by enabling mock dependencies.

==> What are Angular modules, and why are they important?
*  Angular modules (NgModules) are containers for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. Every Angular application has at least one module, the root module, which is bootstrapped to launch the application. NgModules help organize an application into cohesive blocks of functionality and allow for lazy loading of features, improving performance.

==> How do you optimize the performance of an Angular application?
*  Optimizing the performance of an Angular application can be achieved through various techniques:
* Lazy loading modules to reduce initial load time.
* AOT (Ahead of Time) compilation to reduce the size of the compiled code.
* Using Angular's built-in change detection strategy to minimize unnecessary checks.
* Leveraging the OnPush change detection strategy for components that rely on immutable data.
* Minimizing the use of global variables and DOM manipulation.
* Using Angular CLI's production build configuration, which includes tree-shaking, minification, and other optimizations.

==> How do you implement responsive design in Angular?
*  Responsive design in Angular can be implemented using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or by leveraging Angular's built-in features like Angular Flex Layout. Media queries can also be used to apply styles conditionally based on the device's screen size. Additionally, Angular Material provides responsive components that adapt to various screen sizes.

Behavioral and Problem-Solving Questions
----------------------------------------

==> Describe a challenging problem you faced in your previous Angular project and how you solved it.
*  In one of my recent projects, I faced a challenge with managing complex state across multiple components. The application was becoming difficult to manage as the state grew larger and more intricate. I solved this by introducing NgRx for state management, which allowed me to centralize the state and manage it predictably. I defined actions, reducers, and selectors to handle state changes, which significantly improved the code's maintainability and scalability.

==> How do you ensure the quality of your code in Angular projects?
*  I ensure code quality by adhering to best practices like writing modular and reusable code, following Angular's style guide, and conducting thorough unit testing using Jasmine and Karma. I also participate in regular code reviews with the team, where we provide constructive feedback and catch potential issues early. Additionally, I make use of tools like ESLint for linting and Prettier for formatting to maintain a consistent code style.

==> How do you stay up-to-date with the latest trends and updates in Angular development?
*  I stay updated with the latest trends in Angular by following official Angular blog posts, attending webinars and conferences, participating in online communities like Stack Overflow and Reddit, and reading articles on platforms like Medium. I also experiment with new features in personal projects to gain hands-on experience.

==> Can you explain a situation where you had to work closely with designers or back-end developers?
*  In one of my projects, I worked closely with designers to implement a pixel-perfect UI based on their design specifications. This required constant communication to ensure that the design was accurately translated into code while maintaining responsiveness across devices. I also collaborated with back-end developers to integrate RESTful APIs, ensuring that the data was correctly fetched and displayed on the front end.

Conceptual Questions
--------------------

==> What are some common security practices you follow in Angular development?
*  Common security practices in Angular include:
* Avoiding direct use of the innerHTML property to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
* Using Angular's built-in sanitization functions to clean untrusted data.
* Implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* Securing API endpoints and using HTTPS for communication.
* Ensuring that sensitive data is not exposed in the code or through error messages.
* Regularly updating dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

==> Explain the concept of two-way data binding in Angular.
*  Two-way data binding in Angular allows for synchronization between the model and the view. When the data in the model changes, the view is automatically updated, and when the user updates the view (e.g., through input fields), the model is updated as well. This is typically implemented using the ngModel directive in forms.

Advanced Angular Questions
--------------------------

==> What is the difference between AOT (Ahead-of-Time) and JIT (Just-in-Time) compilation in Angular?
*  AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation converts Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build process, before the browser downloads and runs the code. This results in faster rendering because the browser loads pre-compiled code. JIT (Just-in-Time) compilation compiles the code in the browser at runtime, which can slow down the initial load but is useful during development because it provides quick feedback during the development process.

==> How do you implement lazy loading in Angular?
*  Lazy loading in Angular is implemented by defining modules that are loaded on demand rather than at application start. This can be achieved using the loadChildren property in the route configuration. For example:
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'feature', loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule) }
];
This ensures that the FeatureModule is only loaded when the user navigates to the feature route, improving the application's performance.

==> What are Angular decorators, and how are they used?
*  Angular decorators are special functions that attach metadata to classes, methods, properties, or parameters in Angular. They are used to configure the classes that Angular needs to manage and understand. Common decorators include:
*  @Component: Declares a component and its metadata.
*  @NgModule: Declares a module and its metadata.
*  @Injectable: Marks a class as available to be provided and injected as a dependency.
*  @Input and @Output: Bind properties and events between parent and child components.

==> Explain the concept of reactive forms in Angular?
*  Reactive forms in Angular are a more robust and scalable approach to managing forms. They are built using reactive programming principles and provide direct access to form data, validation, and status. Reactive forms are defined using the FormControl, FormGroup, and FormArray classes, allowing for greater control over the form's behavior. For example:
const form = new FormGroup({
  username: new FormControl(''),
  password: new FormControl(''),
});
This approach is particularly useful for complex forms where more explicit control and dynamic validation are required.

==> What are Angular Pipes, and how do you create a custom pipe?
*  Angular Pipes are used to transform data in templates. They take input data and return a transformed output. Angular provides several built-in pipes like DatePipe, CurrencyPipe, and UpperCasePipe. Custom pipes can be created to handle specific data transformations. For example:
@Pipe({ name: 'exponentialStrength' })
export class ExponentialStrengthPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: number, exponent: string): number {
    let exp = parseFloat(exponent);
    return Math.pow(value, isNaN(exp) ? 1 : exp);
  }
}
This custom pipe can be used in a template like this: {{ 2 | exponentialStrength:'10' }}.

==? How do you handle error management in Angular applications?
*  Error management in Angular can be handled using global error handling with the ErrorHandler class. You can create a custom error handler by extending ErrorHandler and implementing the handleError method. Additionally, services and interceptors can be used to manage HTTP errors gracefully. Implementing error logging and user-friendly error messages is also a key part of robust error management.

JavaScript and TypeScript Questions
-----------------------------------

==> What is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript/TypeScript?
*  var is function-scoped and can be re-declared and updated. let is block-scoped and can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope. const is also block-scoped but cannot be updated or re-declared. Using let and const helps prevent issues related to variable hoisting and makes the code more predictable.

==>How does TypeScript improve the development process in Angular?
*  TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, allowing developers to catch type-related errors at compile-time rather than runtime. It provides better tooling support, including IntelliSense, code navigation, and refactoring capabilities. TypeScript also enables the use of modern JavaScript features and syntaxes that may not yet be available in all browsers, improving code quality and maintainability.

==> Can you explain the concept of closures in JavaScript?
*  A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer function's variables even after the outer function has returned. This occurs because the inner function retains a reference to the scope in which it was created. Closures are often used for creating private variables or functions.

Design and Architecture Questions
---------------------------------

==> What is the MVVM architecture, and how does it apply to Angular?
*  MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is a design pattern that separates the development of the graphical user interface from the business logic or back-end logic. In Angular, the Model represents the data, the View represents the UI, and the ViewModel is represented by Angular components, which handle the interaction between the View and the Model. This pattern helps maintain a clear separation of concerns, making the application easier to manage and test.

==> How do you ensure your Angular application is scalable?
*  Ensuring scalability involves several practices:
*  Modularizing the application using Angular modules.
*  Implementing lazy loading to optimize load times.
*  Using state management libraries like NgRx for predictable state management.
*  Writing reusable and maintainable components and services.
*  Implementing code splitting and optimizing bundle sizes.
*  Following best practices in coding, testing, and documentation to facilitate team collaboration and future maintenance.

Behavioral and Teamwork Questions
---------------------------------

==> How do you handle tight deadlines or pressure in your projects?
*  I handle tight deadlines by prioritizing tasks, breaking down the project into manageable chunks, and focusing on delivering high-priority features first. I maintain clear communication with the team and stakeholders to set realistic expectations and provide updates on progress. If necessary, I’m open to working extra hours to meet deadlines while ensuring that the quality of the work remains high.

==> Can you describe a time when you had to give constructive feedback during a code review?
*  In one of the projects, I noticed that a colleague's code had potential performance issues due to inefficient DOM manipulation. During the code review, I provided constructive feedback by explaining the potential impact on performance and suggested an alternative approach using Angular’s built-in features like ngFor and trackBy. The colleague appreciated the feedback, and we collaborated to improve the code, which ultimately enhanced the application's performance.

UI/UX Best Practices Questions
------------------------------

==> What are some key principles of responsive web design that you follow?
*  Key principles of responsive web design include:
Using a fluid grid layout that adjusts based on the screen size.
Implementing flexible images and media that scale with the layout.
Utilizing media queries to apply different styles based on the device's screen size.
Ensuring touch-friendly elements for mobile devices.
Prioritizing content based on the device and providing a seamless experience across all platforms.

==> How do you approach designing a user-friendly interface in Angular?
*  Designing a user-friendly interface involves understanding the end-users’ needs and ensuring that the UI is intuitive, accessible, and easy to navigate. I collaborate closely with designers to implement design specifications accurately and use Angular Material or Bootstrap to create consistent and responsive components. I also focus on performance optimization and ensure that the application is fast and responsive, enhancing the overall user experience.

Angular Advanced Features
=========================

==> What are Angular directives, and how do you create a custom directive?
*  Directives in Angular are classes that add behavior to elements in your Angular applications. There are three types of directives:
Component Directives: Directives with a template (these are regular components).
Structural Directives: Directives that change the structure of the DOM, like *ngIf, *ngFor.
Attribute Directives: Directives that change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive, like ngClass, ngStyle.
To create a custom directive:
@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef) {
    this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
  }
}
This directive will highlight the background of any element it is applied to.

==> What is the role of the Angular Router, and how does it handle navigation?
*  The Angular Router is a powerful tool for enabling navigation within Angular applications. It allows you to map URL paths to components, enabling single-page applications to provide a more dynamic user experience. The router manages navigation through:
Routes: Configured in the RouterModule, where paths are mapped to components.
RouterLink: A directive used in templates to navigate to different routes.
Router.navigate(): A method used in components to programmatically navigate between routes.
Route Guards: Interfaces like CanActivate and CanDeactivate are used to control access to routes based on certain conditions (e.g., authentication).

==> Explain Angular's change detection mechanism.
*  Angular's change detection mechanism is responsible for keeping the view in sync with the model. Angular uses a Zone.js library to detect changes asynchronously and automatically updates the view when the model changes. Change detection in Angular operates in two strategies:
Default: Checks every component in the application, suitable for smaller applications.
OnPush: Optimizes performance by checking only when input properties change or when an event is triggered. This is useful for components with immutable data.

==> What is the difference between @ViewChild and @ContentChild?
*  @ViewChild is used to access a child component, directive, or DOM element from within the same component’s template. It is typically used to interact with child components or manipulate elements directly.
Example:
@ViewChild('myElement') myElement: ElementRef;
@ContentChild, on the other hand, is used to access content projected into a component via <ng-content>. It is useful when you want to interact with elements that are passed to a component from the parent.
Example:
typescript
Copy code
@ContentChild(ChildDirective) contentChild: ChildDirective;

==> How do you handle forms in Angular, and what are the differences between Template-driven and Reactive forms?
*  Angular provides two approaches for handling forms:
Template-driven Forms: Use Angular directives to create forms directly in the template. They are simpler to set up but less scalable and harder to test in complex scenarios.
Reactive Forms: Built using FormGroup, FormControl, and FormArray classes. They provide greater control, allow for dynamic form building, and are more suitable for complex forms. Reactive forms offer better validation logic, easier testing, and more explicit form control.

JavaScript/TypeScript Concepts
------------------------------

==> What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
*  In JavaScript, == is the loose equality operator, which compares two values for equality after converting them to a common type (type coercion). === is the strict equality operator, which compares both the value and the type without converting either. Using === is generally recommended to avoid unexpected behavior due to type coercion.

==> Explain the concept of Promises and Observables. How do they differ?
*  Promises and Observables are both used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript:
Promises: Represent a single value or error that will eventually be available. Once a Promise is resolved or rejected, it cannot be changed.
Observables: Can emit multiple values over time, making them more powerful and flexible than Promises. They are lazy, meaning they don't execute until a subscriber subscribes to them. Observables are cancellable, whereas Promises are not.

Performance Optimization
------------------------

==> What are some techniques for optimizing an Angular application's bundle size?
*  Techniques for optimizing bundle size include:
* AOT Compilation: Reduces the size of the bundle by pre-compiling templates and eliminating the Angular compiler in production.
* Tree Shaking: Removes unused code during the build process.
* Lazy Loading: Loads modules only when they are needed.
* Minification: Compresses the code by removing unnecessary characters like whitespace.
* Using Pure Pipes: Ensures pipes are recalculated only when their inputs change.
* Optimizing images and assets: Reducing the size and number of images, fonts, and other assets.

==>How do you improve the initial load time of an Angular application?
*  To improve the initial load time:
*  Enable AOT Compilation: Speeds up the application by reducing the size of the initial bundle.
*  Use Lazy Loading: Load only the required modules at the start.
* Use Route Preloading: Preloads the routes that are not immediately needed but likely to be navigated soon.
* Optimize CSS and JavaScript: Minify and concatenate files.
* Use Service Workers: Cache assets to avoid repeated downloads.

Testing and Debugging
=====================

==> How do you approach unit testing in Angular?
*  Unit testing in Angular is typically done using Jasmine and Karma. The key approach involves:
*  Testing components, services, pipes, and directives in isolation.
*  Using TestBed to configure the testing module.
*  Mocking dependencies using services or the HttpClient.
*  Using spyOn to mock methods and test interactions.
*  Writing tests to cover all possible code paths, including edge cases.

==> Explain how you debug an Angular application?
*  Debugging an Angular application can be done using:
*  Browser Developer Tools: Inspecting elements, debugging JavaScript code, and monitoring network requests.
*  Angular DevTools: A Chrome extension specifically for Angular, providing insight into the component tree, change detection cycles, and performance.
*  Using Console Logs: Strategically placing console.log statements to trace data and execution flow.
*  Debugging with Breakpoints: Setting breakpoints in the code using developer tools to pause execution and inspect variables.
*  Error Messages and Stack Traces: Interpreting Angular’s error messages and stack traces to identify issues.

Collaboration and Communication
===============================

==> Describe a situation where you had to resolve a conflict within your team.
*  In one of my previous projects, there was a disagreement between team members regarding the approach to implement a feature. To resolve the conflict, I facilitated a meeting where each person could present their reasoning. We then discussed the pros and cons of each approach, considering factors like performance, maintainability, and deadlines. After a thorough discussion, we reached a consensus on the best approach, ensuring that everyone’s concerns were addressed.

==> How do you ensure effective communication with non-technical stakeholders?
*  To communicate effectively with non-technical stakeholders, I focus on using clear, simple language, avoiding jargon, and relating technical concepts to their impact on the project’s goals. I use visual aids like diagrams or mockups to explain complex ideas and ensure that I actively listen to their concerns to provide relevant and understandable feedback. Regular updates and transparent communication help in building trust and aligning everyone’s expectations.

Security Best Practices
=======================

==> What security measures do you implement to protect Angular applications?
*  Security measures in Angular applications include:
*  Sanitizing User Input: Using Angular’s built-in sanitization to protect against XSS attacks.
*  Using HTTP Interceptors: To add authentication tokens to HTTP requests and handle errors.
*  Implementing Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Ensuring that users only have access to what they’re permitted to see.
*  Using Content Security Policy (CSP): To prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts.
*  Avoiding Use of eval(): To prevent code injection.
*  Ensuring Secure API Communication: Using HTTPS and encrypting sensitive data.
*  Regularly Updating Dependencies: To patch vulnerabilities.

==> How do you prevent and handle CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks in Angular applications?
*  CSRF attacks can be prevented by:
*  Using Anti-CSRF Tokens: Ensuring that forms and API requests include a CSRF token that is validated on the server.
*  Validating Origin Headers: On the server-side, validating that requests are coming from the expected origin.
*  SameSite Cookies: Setting cookies with the SameSite attribute to prevent them from being sent on cross-site requests.
*  Using Secure Cookies: Ensuring cookies are transmitted over HTTPS only.

Content projection
===================

Content projection allows you to create flexible and reusable components in Angular by letting you insert content into them from outside. This means you can customize the look and feel of a component by providing different content.

Here’s how it works:

Create a Component: Define a component where you want to allow content projection.
Use the ng-content Tag: Inside your component’s template, place the <ng-content></ng-content> tag where you want the projected content to appear.
Project Content: When you use this component elsewhere, you can insert any content between the component’s opening and closing tags, and it will be projected into the place where the ng-content tag is.

Example:
HTML

<!-- card.component.html -->
<div class="card">
  <ng-content></ng-content>
</div>
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
When you use this CardComponent in another template, you can project content into it:

HTML

<!-- app.component.html -->
<app-card>
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>This is some content inside the card.</p>
</app-card>
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
In this example, the <h2> and <p> tags will be projected into the CardComponent where the ng-content tag is located.

This makes your components highly configurable and reusable!
